"""
In this example, you will learn how to simplify sensor data collection using custom classes.
Instead of directly accessing the sensor data as in the previous example,
we will create universal classes to handle measurements and encapsulate the functionality, making the code more organized, maintainable and versatile.

It requires the adafruit_scd4x library placed in /lib directory.
You can find the library in the CircuitPython library bundle (https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

You can easily use the same structure and concept to interface with other I2C sensors as well.
